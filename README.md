### ELLEN'S REACT PORTFOLIO

### Description 

This Portfolio website involves continuous updates with projects, resume and superb homework.  REACT was implemented using REACT-CREATE-APP.  I specifically used the Switch REACT and a Toggle to enable Dark Mode which was a little more complex with React compared with the JavaScript in the original portfolio.  I created Body, Nav, Footer and Form components and incorporated my original Css into App.css and imported the links BOOTSTRAP and Materialize into the main index.js. HTML, CSS were utilized for the design of the webpage and structuring them to operate with my education and professional experience with links to my conservation work.  It was important to lead the user for a new experience of my pursuits and passions.  The layout is a mobile responsive experience with cards that sequence down the page; with my projects, resume and class assignments following in synchronous way.  I choose keeping the header Assateaugue image of horses because it compliments the rest of the webpage, drawing the audience in as the start of a story of my background and goals.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
