# ELLEN'S REACT PORTFOLIO


### Description 

This Portfolio website is a project that is constantly updating with projects, resume and superb homework.  BOOTSTRAP, HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT were utilized for the design of the webpage and structuring them to operate with my education and professional experience with links to my conservation work.  It was important to lead the user for a new experience of my pursuits and passions.  The layout is a mobile responsive experience with cards that sequence down the page; with my projects, resume and class assignments following in synchronous way.  I choose keeping the header Assateaugue image of horses because it compliments the rest of the webpage, draws the audience in as the start of a story of my background and goals. JavaScript was used to create the DarkMode with help from Geeks for Geeks.
